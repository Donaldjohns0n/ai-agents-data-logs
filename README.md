# AI Agents Data and Logs Repository

Dedicated repository for AI agents data storage, audit logs, provenance tracking, and cross-agent orchestration. This serves as the source-of-truth for all agent activity and compliance records in our multi-agent AI ecosystem.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository implements a comprehensive data governance and orchestration framework for AI agents, providing:

- **Professional Folder Structure**: Organized directories for data, logs, agents, provenance, receipts, compliance, and audit
- **Agent Tracking Manifests**: JSON/YAML configurations for agent deployment and monitoring
- **Receipt System**: Timestamped transaction receipts with agent attribution
- **Data Governance**: Comprehensive policies and compliance framework
- **Cross-Agent Orchestration**: Multi-agent workflow coordination and management
