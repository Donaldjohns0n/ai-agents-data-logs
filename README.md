# AI Agents Data and Logs Repository

Dedicated repository for AI agents data storage, audit logs, provenance tracking, and cross-agent orchestration. This serves as the source-of-truth for all agent activity and compliance records in our multi-agent AI ecosystem.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository implements a comprehensive data governance and orchestration framework for AI agents, providing:

- **Professional Folder Structure**: Organized directories for data, logs, agents, provenance, receipts, compliance, and audit
- **Agent Tracking Manifests**: JSON/YAML configurations for agent deployment and monitoring
- **Receipt System**: Timestamped transaction receipts with agent attribution
- **Data Governance**: Comprehensive policies and compliance framework
- **Cross-Agent Orchestration**: Multi-agent workflow coordination and management

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Workflow Engine**: Support for sequential, parallel, and event-driven workflows
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic agent registration and service mesh integration
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent request distribution across agent instances
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance and graceful degradation

### 2. Comprehensive Audit System
- **Complete Audit Trails**: Every agent operation is tracked and logged
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Real-time compliance verification and reporting
- **Data Lineage**: Full provenance tracking from input to output
- **Transaction Receipts**: Cryptographically signed operation confirmations

### 3. Data Governance Framework
- **Data Classification**: Automatic classification based on content and context
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable data lifecycle management
- **Access Controls**: Fine-grained permission management
- **Privacy Protection**: GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulation compliance

### 4. Security and Compliance
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify approach
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect integration
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in support for GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS

### 5. Interactive Execution Ledger
- **Live Recording**: Agents append entries via `scripts/execution_ledger.py` while executing — one event per write, timestamps assigned by the ledger, never batch-fabricated
- **Tamper Evidence**: SHA-256 hash chain over `logs/execution-ledger/ledger.jsonl` with end-to-end `verify`
- **Constraint Tracking**: Sessions declare `must_not`/`must` constraints; every close carries an upheld/violated report
- **Documentation**: See [docs/EXECUTION_LEDGER.md](docs/EXECUTION_LEDGER.md)
