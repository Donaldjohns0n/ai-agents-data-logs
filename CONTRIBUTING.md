## Data Governance Policies

### 1. Data Ownership and Stewardship

- **Data Stewards**: Each directory has designated data stewards responsible for data quality and compliance
- **Data Owners**: Business units own the data generated by their AI agents
- **Data Custodians**: Technical teams maintain the infrastructure and ensure data integrity

### 2. Data Quality Standards

All data contributions must meet these quality standards:

- **Completeness**: All required fields must be populated
- **Accuracy**: Data must be validated against defined schemas
- **Consistency**: Follow established naming conventions and formats
- **Timeliness**: Data must be recorded within defined SLAs
- **Validity**: All data must pass schema validation

### 3. Data Retention and Lifecycle

| Data Type | Retention Period | Archive Policy | Deletion Policy |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Audit Logs | 7 years | After 2 years | Secure deletion after retention |
| Performance Logs | 1 year | After 3 months | Automated cleanup |
| Provenance Data | 5 years | After 1 year | Business approval required |
| Receipts | 10 years | After 3 years | Legal approval required |
| Compliance Records | Indefinite | After 5 years | Never (archive only) |

## Data Classification and Handling

### Classification Levels

1. **Public**: Information that can be freely shared
2. **Internal**: Information for internal use only
3. **Restricted**: Sensitive information requiring special handling
4. **Confidential**: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls

### Handling Requirements

#### Public Data
- No special handling requirements
- Can be stored in standard repositories
- Standard backup and recovery procedures

#### Internal Data
- Access controls required
- Encrypted in transit and at rest
- Regular access reviews
- Standard retention policies apply

#### Restricted Data
- Role-based access controls (RBAC)
- Additional encryption requirements
- Quarterly access reviews
- Extended audit logging
- Data loss prevention (DLP) monitoring

#### Confidential Data
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Advanced encryption (AES-256)
- Monthly access reviews
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Segregated storage systems
- Executive approval for access

## Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Data Submission Process

1. **Schema Validation**: All data must validate against published schemas
2. **Metadata Requirements**: Include complete metadata with all submissions
3. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for new data types
4. **Testing**: Test data submissions in development environment first
5. **Review Process**: All contributions require peer review

### 2. File Naming Conventions

```bash
# Logs
{service}-{type}-{YYYYMMDD}.{jsonl|json}
# Example: ml-training-audit-20241219.jsonl

# Receipts
{type}-receipt-{YYYYMMDD}.json
# Example: api-service-call-receipt-20241219.json

# Manifests
{agent-name}-{type}.{yaml|json}
# Example: data-processing-agent.yaml

# Provenance
{resource-id}-lineage.json
# Example: sentiment-model-v2.3-lineage.json
```
